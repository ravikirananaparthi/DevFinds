# Project Name: Dev Finds

## Overview

Welcome to the DevFinds' Work-Based Experience Sharing Platform! This platform is designed to facilitate programming students in capturing their work-based experiences and sharing them with other students. Users can share their learning experiences through text, photos, or videos, making it a versatile platform for knowledge exchange and collaboration.

## Features

-   **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and securely authenticate using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
-   **Real-time Communication**: Integration of Socket.io enables real-time communication between users, fostering instant interaction and collaboration.
-   **Database Management**: MongoDB is used as the database, with the Mongoose library for efficient data modeling and management.
-   **Cookie Parsing**: Cookie parsing is implemented for managing user sessions securely.
-   **Documentation**: The project is thoroughly documented to aid developers in understanding and contributing to the codebase.
